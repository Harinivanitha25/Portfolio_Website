This is my first Front-end project which is my Portfolio Website.
It consists of all the assets i have used in the Portfolio.
I am happy that I have used git to push the code from VS Code to Github.

I have done my first portfolio website and done the deployment by Github Pages.
Here is the link where my portfolio is live at https://harinivanitha25.github.io/Portfolio_Website.
